# Convert coordinates L-Est97 and WGS84

This is a module that converts coordinates from WGS84 to L-Est97 and vice versa.

A geographic coordinate system (GCS) is a coordinate system which uses a three-dimensional spherical surface (ellipsoid)
to define locations on the earth. A common choice of coordinates is latitude and longitude.
For example, main entrance of Taltech IT College is located on 59.395312° North and 24.664182° East in the WGS84 coordinate system.

In a projected coordinate system (PCS) you project the geographic coordinate that you have measured,
to, for example, a cylinder which you roll out easily on two-dimensional surface (the map).
There exist many projections.
For example, main entrance of Taltech IT College is located on X=6584338.65 and Y=537735.47 in the Estonian L-Est97 coordinate system.
NB X-axe direction is to North and Y-axe direction is to East.
